This is pal's blog 1. <br />
This blog is a collection of my writings, thoughts, opinions. I believe that knowledege grows by sharing, so that's what I am looking forward to. <br /> <br />
On 1st Jan this year, I took a resolve to have a website by the end of June, where I can write about stuff in greater lengths than the twitter's 280 character limit.ðŸ˜… And I believe writing is a good way of expressing oneself. Since I was a kid, I was always fantasized about sitting a cafe and writing a book. So not a book, but this seems like a good start. The beauty about blogging is that everyone can have one, and every blog out there will still be very different.<br /><br />
Learning is not a straight path, it's a zig-zag line of wins and momentary drops coupled with imposter syndrome, ðŸ˜‰.<br />
Now now, my aim isn't to demotivate or scare away the reader, but to almost provide a realistic view of what having a life full of learning could be. <br /><br />
I am 20, I have considerable amount of learning to look forward to, but I am pretty sure I'll be learning along the way alright. And that's where these blogs play a role of staying on for a longer time then I can actually manage to remember so much stuff. <br /><br />
Looks like I completed my resolution of getting a blog site up before June, well now this is where it get's interesting. This isn't a one time thing, I don't want this blog to be lurking in some corner of the internet, but still I won't over-promise, I will be updating this site with blogs to read whenever I have something nice and fresh ready and I think is clean and easy enough for people to understand. <br /><br />
So look forward to some exciting stuff to read when I do publish.<br /> The next one is going to be a bit more technical!
