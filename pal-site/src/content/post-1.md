Hi, I am Aayush Pal, a Mobile Developer, Tech enthusiast. I build applications for android & iOS based on Flutter.
I am currently a 2nd year Computer Engineering student, trying to find the next project to be a part of. 

My experience revolves in a major portion around Flutter & cloud services like MongoDB and Firebase.

I am fairly active on social media, go ahead and check me out haha, and I am more than happy to connect. 
This website is a culmination of everything thought cycle I bump, a journal of sorts.
