Hello there! I am Aayush Pal, a Software EngineerðŸ“±. <br />
I work on a variety of technologies, most of the time I spend building applications for android & iOS using Flutter. Right now, I am building mobile apps [@MakeStories](https://makestories.io/)<br />
I am currently a 3rd year CS student, trying to build my next product.

I am fairly active on social media, I am more than happy to connect. <br />
This website/blog is a collection of thoughts, opinions I have, a journal of sorts.ðŸ“‘ <br /> So read away!
