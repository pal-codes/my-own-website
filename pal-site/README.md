## 🚀 Overview

This website is built using Gatsby and based on the Jula Starter pack.

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the julia starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the julia starter
    gatsby new julia-starter https://github.com/niklasmtj/gatsby-starter-julia
    ```

2.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

     ```sh
     # run the gatsby project within the src folder.
     gatsby develop
     ```

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `julia-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js` or `src/pages/blog.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

### The src directory

    .
    ├── components
    ├── content
    ├── images
    ├── pages
    └── templates

1. **`/components`**: Your React components can be defined here. You can include them from there in your pages.

2. **`/content`**: The filesystem plugin is configured to get the `*.md` files from here. These will be published on the `/blog` page.

3. **`/images`**: This directory is the home for your images that you can query via GraphQL since the filesystem plugin publish them there.

4. **`/pages`**: Here is where your pages like `/blog`, `/about` and also the 404 page lives. An example of the basic structure can be found above.

5. **`/templates`**: You will find the `blog-post.js` template there which defines how every blog-post page is structured.
