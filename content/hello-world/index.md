Oh hello there! I am **Aayush**, just a programmer who likes anything that has to do with computers. <br /> A daresay ***linux*** person 😊 and someone who likes to read. <br />
I work on a variety of technologies, most times you can find me building applications using Flutter. <br />
Right now caught up with pursuing my Computer Engineering degree 👨🏽‍🎓, also trying to build my next product.

I am fairly active on social media, feel free to get in touch! 🥨<br />
This website/blog is a collection of thoughts, opinions I have, a journal of sorts. 📑 <br /> ***So read away...***
