Hi there fellow reader, good to have you here. ðŸ¤—
Though the header seems like it, I am not going to focus on the HOW of contributing to opensource, because the tools and resources out there do a better job at that.
**What I wanna share is my personal opinion on the WHY**?

_Learning comes from doing._

What I mean to point out is, if you'd like to be a great artist someday, it's not the talent, it's the continuous efforts and practice that will make you great. For every profession/passion in this world, consistency is important.
And from what I have learned by being active in the developer community and tech industry as a whole, is that you need to be at the top of your game most of the time. Now I don't mean that you should be extremely pundit about your opinions or be a 10x engineer, what I wanna highlight is that being a good engineer or programmer takes time and experience.

Today will focus on that. Time and Experience.

One thing I have always appreciated that is ever-present for every developer out there is the open-source community. And being part of one, makes you feel responsible. And believe me, it's great.

I am writing this blog in November, that means Hacktoberfest was just a couple of weeks ago. And although I wasn't new to opensource as a concept, this year was my first year trying out Hacktoberfest. I went on GitHub to check the projects out there that need contribution, well I expected stuff to be really difficult because an okayishly sized project can take at least a week for the developer to get acquainted with and on top of that you need to make 4 contributions. I was kinda disappointed when I came across some repos made just for the purpose of letting people score the 4 PRs quickly. I worked on 2 repos, I wasn't looking for any t-shirts. If you were anywhere near tech Twitter in October 2020, you might have already guessed what I mean by that remark.ðŸ˜„

Coming to my original question of WHY?
Opensource projects, teams, open up opportunities for just about any developer in the world to just go ahead and start working on real-world projects, given you act kindly.ðŸ˜‰
I contributed to a Chat SDK, with almost no idea or experience in doing that before. The only stack I had considerable experience with was Flutter and I ended up making my contribution in Kotlin.

Opensource is the best way to keep doing and learning. You don't need to have done some massive amounts of research before you make your first repository public on GitHub or even need to have a contribution to the freaking **Linux** repo. What matters is you start, that you go, make a repo, and start putting stuff together.

#### This tweet puts my opinion in a better way:

A lot of the times what I face difficulty with is thinking about what should I build, who should I build it with, what language should I learn, or go forthwith. Although these are not the wrong questions, they do take up time that we could spend doing something better.

Opensource helps you get started and find an aim for yourself to work on things you like. Being a contributor brings you responsibility and that brings out the best in you. Consistency is maintained as a result of you wanting to learn more while you also contribute to opensource.

I also wanna talk about why contributing just for the sake of making a good looking portfolio or making your profile look busier and greener on GitHub is not the right thing to do. Why because the motive here is so wrong on so many points. The first thing that matters is the contribution you make should really bring value to the maintainers, and by this again I don't mean to start writing some huge task-oriented lambda functions on the first commit, but instead make smaller good thought-out improvements or changes that you believe will improve the experience of the next person coming to that project.
For a fact, my first contribution to Firebase Docs was a document correction, but the correction only came to me because I had been using Firebase for my projects for a while and I knew an integral step was missing that would just divert newcomers and get them confused because of probable environment setup errors.

Opensource is a cycle of people, software, passion that run beautifully together and when done nicely, can be fruitful for everyone involved and that is so powerful.
