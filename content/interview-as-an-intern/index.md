So this year I gave 2 interviews that I consider, were very insightful. And I have already got so much to write about them.
I think maybe this experience will help you out in some way down the line.

Well for starters, both the interviews were pretty nice and very experience/role focused rather than the usual problem-solving and algorithm bs. I was asked to build something in the context of my role and been given a period of 3 days to get it done.

Now obviously both of them went in very different ways in part due to my having more experience for one of those roles.

I'd like to divide this blog in 2 parts

1. What the company is looking for?
2. What you should be looking for?

### What the company is looking for? 

Most times the HR or the person hiring is aware of what they need within their teams or what they are supposed to be looking for. As a candidate, you play a big role in letting the hiring person get to know you but in a passive way. This could be through your social handles or if you have a blog where you post your opinions. Now mind you, You gotta be unique, well basically that means just be You.
The person might reach out to you, or maybe this was a role they just opened up and they wanna get to know you. If you are a culture fit, a stack fit, and if you have enough experience to build what the company is currently building.

There's also the possibility of you typing up a cold email, text, or a video!? That is you approaching the team first, and there may or may not be an open role fitting to your tech-stack. But that's fine because we as engineers aren't tied to one thing. We use the best tool in the toolbox to get the job done nicely and cough\* also the tech industry is pretty volatile.

Now coming to interview part, different companies have different ways of conducting an interview. Both the companies I applied to were startups, so their process was pretty similar on some level.

But let's say you get a task to work on from your interview, make sure you approach it in a holistic way. Most often than not, companies don't look for you (if this is your first role) to be completing the task. It's more about what and how you do it. Because from my understanding most of the things you do at a company is

### What you should be looking for?

This is a really subjective opinion.
But my first priority to check within any team I might join is the team itself. People matter to me. A good team ensures growth and well happiness when you are working beside them. You don't wanna be sitting next to an exhausted-for-life-attitude kinda person for a lifetime right?
